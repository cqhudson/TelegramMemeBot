# Telegram Meme Bot

This is a simple Telegram bot that finds memes based on an API, and then sends the memes to the user that requested them as a Telegram message.

To use the bot, open the following link [t.me/connors_meme_bot](https://t.me/connors_meme_bot)

Here is a list of current supported commands by the bot:

- `/start` - show welcome command and usage
- `/meme` - fetch a random meme from Reddit (chosen from either *r/memes*, *r/dankmemes*, or *r/me_irl*)
- `/source` - fetch a random meme from a specific subreddit (Currently supported subreddits are *r/memes*, *r/dankmemes*, *r/wholesomememes*, and *r/nsfwmemes*. This is subject to change in the future)
